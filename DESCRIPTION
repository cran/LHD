Description: Contains different algorithms for efficient Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) with flexible sizes. Our package is comprehensive since it is capable of generating maximin distance LHDs, maximum projection LHDs, and nearly orthogonal LHDs. Documentation for each algorithm includes useful information and explanation along with corresponding references. This package is particularly useful in the area of Design and Analysis of Experiments (DAE). More specifically, design of computer experiments.
