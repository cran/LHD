Description: Contains different algorithms and construction methods for efficient Latin hypercube designs (LHDs) with flexible sizes. Our package is comprehensive since it is capable of generating maximin distance LHDs, maximum projection LHDs, and orthogonal and nearly orthogonal LHDs. Documentations for all the algorithms and construction methods include informative explanation along with corresponding references. This package is particularly useful in the area of Design and Analysis of Experiments (DAE). More specifically, design of computer experiments.
